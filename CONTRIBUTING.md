## Contribution Guidelines

To be able to contribute to Docuco you need to understand the architecture and the codebase. 

The project is divided into three main folders: `_core`, `web_app`, and `http_rest_api`.

The `_core` folder contains all the domain logic used in the backend side. Inside this folder, you will find the different contexts, and each context follows an hexagonal architecture with DDD. Follow the same pattern when adding new features or fixing bugs.

Inside `(web_app)` you will find the frontend side of the project. This project is built with Next.js and Mantine.

Lastly, the `(http_rest_api)` folder contains all the routes and controllers for the REST API.

We use Just and Docker Compose to develop and run the project. Make sure you have both installed on your machine and feel free see the `Justfile` to see all the available commands.
